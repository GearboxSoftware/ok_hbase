<h2>
<a name="what" class="anchor" href="#what"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What?</h2>

<p>ok_hbase is a lightweight Hbase Adapter for Ruby applications that don't have the option of running in JRuby.
You can use ok_hbase in anything CLI Ruby scripts to a Sinatra or Rails application: 'OkHbase::ActiveModel` is a good starting point for those more comfortable with ActiveRecord.</p>

<h2>
<a name="why" class="anchor" href="#why"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h2>

<p>There is a lack of good gems to interface with HBase from Ruby (not JRuby).<br>
Gems like <a href="https://github.com/sishen/hbase-ruby">hbase-ruby</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/bmuller/hbaserb">hbaserb</a> are too basic; <a href="https://github.com/greglu/hbase-stargate">hbase-stargate</a> uses REST, not Thrift; <a href="https://github.com/sqs/rhino">Rhino</a> hasn't been updaed in 3 years; and finally, <a href="https://github.com/CompanyBook/massive_record">Massive Record</a> does not meet our performance expectations.  </p>

<p>After limping along with Massive Record for too long, I decided it would be better and quicker to start from scratch than to try to <a href="https://github.com/okcwest/massive_record">fix</a> Massive Record.</p>

<p>Besides, it's an interesting exercise!</p>

<a name="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h2>

<h3>
<a name="speed" class="anchor" href="#speed"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Speed</h3>

<p>One of the biggest issues we've seen with usage Massive Record is speed, or lack there of. We use HBase to back the messaging system on <a href="http://www.kiss.com">Kiss.com</a>, and for users with large inboxes, retrieval is painfully slow (~1000+ messages take 20sec or more). Writes were slow too, ~500ms is the norm. Some of this slowness is probably due to improper HBase configuration, but we saw signifigant <a href="https://github.com/okcwest/subspace/wiki/HBase-Benchmarking-Notes">differences</a> reading the same data from different libraries. So we know it's possible to have faster HBase code in Ruby.</p>

<h3>
<a name="simplicity" class="anchor" href="#simplicity"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Simplicity</h3>

<p>We have come to the conclusion (somewhat obvious in hindsight) that a traditional ORM pattern is a poor fit for HBase, and the overhead not only slows things down, but unnecessarily complicates things. With ok-hbase I am trying to find a balance: keep it simple, but still provide some nice features above and beyond being just a thin wrapper around the Thrift libraries.</p>

<h3>
<a name="flexibility" class="anchor" href="#flexibility"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flexibility</h3>

<p>Building just another thin wrapper around the Thrift libraries wouldn't be very useful, so with ok-hbase, I hope to provide a bit more. While a traditional ORM is not a good fit for HBase, there are some ORM-like features that would be nice to have. These features will be implemented as mixins or concerns: You can use the basic table class, or subclass it and add the mixins you want. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/okcwest-projects/ok-hbase/wiki#todo">TODO</a> section to see what's planned.</p>
